/**
 * The live filter set for one table, restored from and saved to the user's
 * preferences.
 *
 * Every filterable table shares this because the failure modes are not about
 * filtering at all - they are about the restore racing the user:
 *
 *  - `hydratedScope` stops the restore from repeating. Each save writes the
 *    react-query cache optimistically, so without it every keystroke would
 *    re-run the effect and overwrite the state being typed.
 *  - a commit claims the scope as hydrated immediately. The preferences fetch
 *    can resolve at ANY point, including between two keystrokes, and a restore
 *    landing after an edit silently discards it - a filter that erases itself
 *    while you set it.
 *  - a scope change clears first and restores second. Carrying one view's
 *    filters into another for even one frame shows rows filtered by columns the
 *    new view does not have.
 *
 * @param scope identifies the table - build it with `tableFilterScope`.
