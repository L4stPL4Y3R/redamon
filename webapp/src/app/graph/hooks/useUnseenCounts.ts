/**
 * Unseen-row badges for the graph table tabs.
 *
 * A tab's badge counts the ROWS THAT TAB WOULD SHOW which were written after
 * the instant that user last had it open - the route works that out per tab, so
 * a badge and an empty table can never disagree. Three rules make it behave:
 *
 *  1. **Seeding.** A tab with no stored watermark is not "everything is new" -
 *     it is a user who has never had badges before. The first response seeds
 *     every unseen tab from the server clock, so the feature ships showing zero
 *     rather than twenty four-digit badges.
 *  2. **Server time only.** Watermarks are stamped from the graph's clock
 *     (corrected for browser skew between polls). A client running fast would
 *     otherwise write a watermark into the future and permanently hide the next
 *     scan's findings.
 *  3. **Open means seen.** The active tab is re-marked on every poll, so a tab
 *     the user is actually looking at never accumulates a badge.
