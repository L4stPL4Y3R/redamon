 * connection pool. This used to return a FRESH driver on every call when
 * NODE_ENV=production (only development reused the singleton), so every request
 * built a new pool of up to `maxConnectionPoolSize` Bolt connections and
 * abandoned it -- `closeDriver()` is never called per-request. That leaked
 * connections and memory continuously and produced Neo4j's
 * "Increase in network aborts detected" on a busy instance.
 *
 * All environments now share one instance. `global` (not a module-level `let`)
 * because Next.js dev hot-reload re-evaluates the module and would otherwise
 * strand the previous driver.
