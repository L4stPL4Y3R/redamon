"""
Scan Timeline — the Scan Scheduler worker (plan Section 7.2).

The orchestrator owns admission and the container spawn, so it owns the TICK; the
webapp owns the version freeze and the ScanJob history, so it owns the RUN. On
each tick the worker:

  1. asks the webapp which schedules are due
     (``GET /api/internal/scan-schedules/due``),
  2. defers any whose project is mid-activation (F3: never spawn into an in-flight
     graph swap) — the deferral is recorded as a ``deferred_ram``-style ScanJob
     with a "graph busy" reason and retried on a later tick,
  3. defers any that clearly cannot be admitted right now, using a NON-RESERVING
     read of the ledger (``remaining_for_new()`` vs ``envelope_for()``). The real,
     authoritative reservation still happens inside ``start_recon``'s
     ``_admit_scan`` when the webapp calls us back — pre-reserving here would leak
     an envelope whenever the spawn is then rejected for another reason,
  4. otherwise asks the webapp to run it
     (``POST /api/internal/scan-schedules/{id}/run``), which goes through exactly
     the same start path as a manual scan: activation lock, freeze-before-start,
     RoE time window / hard guardrail, admission, ScanJob history.

Never raises into the event loop: every iteration is wrapped, because a scheduler
that dies silently is worse than one that skips a tick.
